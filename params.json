Popularized by foursquare, farmville, and others, badges are powerful ways to encourage desired user behaviors in your app by turning your app itself into a \"game\".\r\n\r\nKey benefits of the SDK include:\r\n\r\n* Centralized location to define all badge related logic, including earning criteria, images, and text, for non-programmers.\r\n\r\n* Simple API call for the app to report user activities for earning badges.\r\n\r\n* Automatically keep track and manage the user's badge status.\r\n\r\n* Notifying the hosting app badge status changes (e.g., earning a new badge).\r\n\r\n* Ready-to-use and easy-to-extend view controllers to display and interact with badges.\r\n\r\n* Built-in support for sharing badges.\r\n\r\n* Ready-to-use library of badge images.\r\n\r\n![badges](screenshots/img1.png) ![badge actions](screenshots/img2.png)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nDrag the <code>libBadgeKit.a</code> file into the Frameworks section of your XCode project. And make sure that it is included in your product targets.\r\n\r\nDrag <code>BadgeKit.h</code> header file into the source section of your XCode project.\r\n\r\nCreate a <code>BCBadgeDefinition.plist</code> file to define all badge images, text, and award criteria. An example of this file is given in the next section. For now, just remember that each badge has a \"metric\" property associated with it. Once the metric property reaches certain value, a new level of the badge will be awarded to the user. For instance, the metric <code>officialuser</code> might refer to the number of times the user opens the app. The user could get an \"silver level official user\" badge once it reaches 5.\r\n\r\nInitialize the <code>BCBadgeManager</code> object in your application delegate.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application \r\n              didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\r\n    self.manager = [[BCBadgeManager alloc] init];\r\n    ... ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThroughout your application, you can make a simple API call to report activities tracked by badges. The badges are represented here by its metric name.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n[[BCBadgeManager sharedManager] incrementMetric:@\"officialuser\" by:1];\r\n```\r\n\r\nDisplay the badges in a built-in view controller. You can get the view controller as follows, and then you can present it from your current view controller.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\nUIViewController* badgeView = [[BCBadgeManager sharedManager] badgeViewController];    \r\n[self presentModalViewController:badgeView animated:YES];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Define your badges\r\n\r\nHere is an example of <code>BCBadgeDefinition.plist</code> file. It defines two badges.\r\n\r\n* The <code>officialuser</code> badge is tracked by the <code>officialuser</code> metric. When the metric has value between 0 to 4, the image officialuser-1.png is display for the badge; when the metric value is from 5 to 24, the officialuser-2.png is display for the badge; etc. The messages correspond to the messages to display when the user taps on the badge or shares the badge.\r\n\r\n* The <code>7daystretch</code> badge is tracked by the <code>daysused</code> metric. When the metric has value between 0 to 6, the image 7daystretch-1.png is display for the badge; when the metric value is from 7 to 13, the 7daystretch-2.png is display for the badge; etc. The messages correspond to the messages to display when the user taps on the badge or shares the badge.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\r\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\r\n<dict>\r\n  <key>metrics</key>\r\n  <array>\r\n    <string>officialuser</string>\r\n    <string>daysused</string>\r\n  </array>\r\n\r\n  <key>badges</key>\r\n  <array>\r\n    <dict>\r\n      <key>levels</key>\r\n      <array>\r\n        <integer>0</integer>\r\n        <integer>5</integer>\r\n        <integer>25</integer>\r\n        <integer>50</integer>\r\n      </array>\r\n      <key>messages</key>\r\n      <array>\r\n        <string>Please open the app at least 5 times to earn this badge!</string>\r\n        <string>a silver level badge for Official User!</string>\r\n        <string>a gold level badge for Official User!</string>\r\n        <string>a diamond level badge for Official User!</string>\r\n      </array>\r\n      <key>id</key>\r\n      <string>officialuser</string>\r\n      <key>name</key>\r\n      <string>Official User</string>\r\n      <key>metric</key>\r\n      <string>officialuser</string>\r\n    </dict>\r\n\r\n    <dict>\r\n      <key>levels</key>\r\n      <array>\r\n        <integer>0</integer>\r\n        <integer>7</integer>\r\n        <integer>14</integer>\r\n        <integer>21</integer>\r\n      </array>\r\n      <key>messages</key>\r\n      <array>\r\n        <string>Please use the app at least once a day for 7 days in a row to earn this badge.</string>\r\n        <string>a badge for using the app 7 days in a row!</string>\r\n        <string>a badge for using the app 14 days in a row!</string>\r\n        <string>a badge for using the app 21 days in a row!</string>\r\n      </array>\r\n      <key>id</key>\r\n      <string>7daystretch</string>\r\n      <key>name</key>\r\n      <string>7 Day Stretch</string>\r\n      <key>metric</key>\r\n      <string>daysused</string>\r\n    </dict>\r\n  </array>\r\n    \r\n  <key>background</key>\r\n  <string>metal-2.jpg</string>\r\n</dict>\r\n</plist>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Receive notifications\r\n\r\nThe SDK emits two notifications for the hosting app to process.\r\n\r\nThe <code>kBCNotificationMetricChanged</code> is sent whenever a badge metric is changed. The userInfo of this notification contains the metric name and value.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n-(void) metricChanged:(NSNotification*) notification {\r\n    NSDictionary* info = [notification userInfo];\r\n    NSString* metricName = [info objectForKey:@\"metric\"];\r\n    NSNumber* value      = [info objectForKey:@\"value\"];\r\n\r\n    ... ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe <code>kBCNotificationLevelUp</code> is sent whenever a new badge level is reached. The userInfo of the notification contains the badge itself.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n-(void) levelUp:(NSNotification*) notification{\r\n    NSDictionary* info = [notification userInfo];    \r\n    BCBadge* badge = [info objectForKey:@\"badge\"];\r\n    ... ...\r\n}\r\n```","tagline":"Gamify your mobile apps","google":""}
